# Centipad

Have you ever signed an agreement without reading all the terms?

Centipad is your personal document crawler, designed to summarize agreements down to what you need to know, warn you about potential loopholes, and keep you informed of your legal rights. If it's illegal, it doesn't apply even if you signed it.
